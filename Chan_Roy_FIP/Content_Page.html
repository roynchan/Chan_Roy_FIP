                <p class="margin-tb">The earliest documented record of cold brew coffee is called “Kyoto”, 
                    which originated in Japan during the 1600s. This type of coffee earned
                     its name due to the popularity of the drink in the city of Kyoto. 
                    The Japanese would brew cold coffee for hours, extracting every flavor 
                    from the bean; they even invented elegant machines to brew the coffee in 
                    public spaces. They would let each bead of water drip down the tower and 
                    pass through the coffee grounds, creating a public spectacle out of the 
                    mystery and wonder surrounding the cold brew process. 
                    Although this is the first evidence of cold brew coffee, 
                    it is unknown whether this drink and methodology existed previously. 
                    Some people believe the process may have been introduced to 
                    Japan by Dutch traders from Indonesia. It is argued that it could have been 
                    developed for the purpose of transporting large quantities of strong coffee 
                    which later could be reheated or served cold.</p>

                    since at least the 17th Century.
                    When looking at traditional coffee prepared in Italian homes, 
                    it is believed the cappuccino is probably the base of the invention for the 
                    Americanized caffè latte. In a traditional cappuccino, 
                    the milk is warmed and frothed, not steamed and 
                    the strong espresso coffee is then added to the hot milk. 
                    It was the strong espresso that Americans were averse to, 
                    hence the addition of the milk to help take
                     the edge off. The term “caffe e latte” was first used by 
                    William Dean Howells in his 1867 essay “Italian Journeys”. 
                    At this point in history, coffee is starting to become a worldwide sensation,

                <p class="margin-tb">In Europe, coffee drinking was originally based on the 
                    traditional Ottoman style of preparation. 
                    Water and coffee beans were brought to a boil, 
                    and sometimes sugar was added. 
                    This is similar to modern-day Turkish coffee preparation.
                    By the late 1700s, the British and French had started filtering coffee beans
                     from their coffee. Gradually, filtered and brewed coffee became 
                    more popular than boiled coffee. 
                    It was around this time that the term 'cappuccino' originated</p>

                        intuitive that it would predate time, but the ancestry of our modern-day 
                        mocha is often traced back to eighteenth-century Italy. 
                        (Alas—there was no Reeses-style moment where a chocolatier accidentally 
                        tripped and toppled a dollop of chocolate into some goatherd’s coffee pot.) 
                        A drink made from coffee, chocolate, and cream known as the 
                        bavaresia was popular in Turin, Italy, where a coffee bar called 
                        Caffè al Bicerin elevated the drink to some level of acclaim—and
                         renamed it the bicerin, also the name of the small glass in which it 
                        was consumed (consider this the early progenitor of the Gibraltar).
                         Originally served in deconstructed form, where the drinker mixed 
                        the parts together themselves, it came to be offered as a fully 
                        prepared drink, cementing the popularity of this flavor profile as 
                        something ready right off the menu.
